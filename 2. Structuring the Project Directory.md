## 2: Structuring the Project Directory  

Now that the repository is set up, we need to create a structured folder layout for the Library Management System. This will help keep the project organized as each student works on different aspects.  

#### **Instructions:**  
1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**  
   Open your terminal or command prompt and go to the project folder:  
   ```bash
   cd Library-Management-System
   ```

2. **Create the Necessary Folders and Files:**  
   Run the following commands to set up the basic project structure:  
   ```bash
   mkdir backend frontend database docs tests
   touch backend/__init__.py backend/book.py backend/member.py backend/transaction.py
   touch frontend/index.html frontend/style.css frontend/script.js
   touch database/db_connection.py database/schema.sql
   touch README.md .gitignore requirements.txt
   ```

   - `backend/` → Contains Python files for handling books, members, and transactions.  
   - `frontend/` → Contains HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files for the user interface.  
   - `database/` → Manages database connection and schema.  
   - `docs/` → Stores documentation files.  
   - `tests/` → Will hold test cases later.  
   - `README.md` → Project documentation.  
   - `.gitignore` → Ignores unnecessary files.  
   - `requirements.txt` → Will store dependencies later.

3. **Commit and Push the Changes:**  
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Project structure setup"
   git push origin main
   ```

### **Task for Students:**  
- Pull the latest changes from GitHub:  
  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```
- Explore the folder structure and understand its purpose.
