## 5: Setting Up the Database Connection  

Now that the database schema is ready, the student responsible for **database connection** (Student 4) will set up the connection using Python and MySQL.  

---

### **Instructions for Student 4 (Database Connection)**  

1. **Ensure MySQL is installed and running**  
   - Install MySQL if not already installed.  
   - Create the database using the schema from the previous step.  
   - Log in to MySQL and execute the following:  
     ```sql
     CREATE DATABASE library_management;
     ```

2. **Install MySQL Connector for Python**  
   Run the following command in your terminal:  
   ```bash
   pip install mysql-connector-python
   ```

3. **Write the Database Connection Code**  
   Open the file `database/db_connection.py` and add the following code:  

   ```python
   import mysql.connector

   # Database connection settings
   DB_CONFIG = {
       "host": "localhost",  # Change if using a remote server
       "user": "root",  # Change if using a different MySQL user
       "password": "your_password",  # Update with your MySQL password
       "database": "library_management"
   }

   def get_db_connection():
       """Establishes a database connection and returns the connection object."""
       try:
           conn = mysql.connector.connect(**DB_CONFIG)
           print("Database connection successful")
           return conn
       except mysql.connector.Error as err:
           print(f"Error: {err}")
           return None

   # Test the connection
   if __name__ == "__main__":
       connection = get_db_connection()
       if connection:
           connection.close()
   ```

4. **Test the Connection**  
   - Run the script to check if the connection is successful:  
     ```bash
     python database/db_connection.py
     ```
   - If you see `"Database connection successful"`, it works correctly.

5. **Commit and Push Changes to GitHub**  
   ```bash
   git add database/db_connection.py
   git commit -m "Added database connection script"
   git push origin main
   ```

### **Instructions for All Students**  
- **Pull the latest changes:**  
  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```
- **Test the connection** on their local machine by running:  
  ```bash
  python database/db_connection.py
  ```
