## 1: Setting Up the Project Repository on GitHub  

Since this is a collaborative project, the first step is to create a GitHub repository where all students can contribute.  

#### **Instructions:**  
1. **Create a GitHub Repository:**  
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and log in.  
   - Click on the **New Repository** button.  
   - Name the repository **Library-Management-System** (or a suitable name).  
   - Select **Public** (or Private if you prefer).  
   - Check the box for **Add a README file** (to provide project details).  
   - Click **Create Repository**.  

2. **Initialize the Project on Your Local System:**  
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.  
   - Clone the repository:  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/Library-Management-System.git
     ```
   - Navigate to the project folder:  
     ```bash
     cd Library-Management-System
     ```
   - Create a `.gitignore` file (to exclude unnecessary files):  
     ```bash
     echo "__pycache__/" >> .gitignore
     ```
   - Create an empty `main.py` file:  
     ```bash
     touch main.py
     ```

3. **Push Initial Commit:**  
   - Add all files:  
     ```bash
     git add .
     ```
   - Commit the changes:  
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Initial project setup"
     ```
   - Push to GitHub:  
     ```bash
     git push origin main
     ```

4. **Add Students as Collaborators:**  
   - On GitHub, go to your repository.  
   - Click on **Settings > Collaborators**.  
   - Invite your students by their GitHub usernames or emails.  

### **Task for Students:**  
- Accept the GitHub invitation.  
- Clone the repository to their local machines.
