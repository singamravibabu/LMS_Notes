## 3: Assigning Responsibilities to Students  

Now that the project structure is ready, each student should be assigned a specific module to work on. Since we have 10 students, we will distribute the work as follows:  

#### **Module Assignments:**  
| Student | Responsibility | Files to Work On |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|
| Student 1 | Book Management (CRUD) | `backend/book.py` |
| Student 2 | Member Management (CRUD) | `backend/member.py` |
| Student 3 | Transaction Management (Issue/Return Books) | `backend/transaction.py` |
| Student 4 | Database Connection | `database/db_connection.py` |
| Student 5 | Database Schema (Tables for books, members, transactions) | `database/schema.sql` |
| Student 6 | HTML for User Interface | `frontend/index.html` |
| Student 7 | CSS for Styling | `frontend/style.css` |
| Student 8 | JavaScript for Frontend Logic | `frontend/script.js` |
| Student 9 | API Integration (Backend-Frontend Communication) | Will be defined later |
| Student 10 | Testing and Documentation | `tests/`, `docs/` |

#### **Instructions:**  
1. **Each student should:**  
   - Navigate to their respective file/folder:  
     ```bash
     cd Library-Management-System
     ```
   - Open the assigned file in a code editor and add a comment with their name:  
     ```python
     # This file is managed by [Your Name]
     ```
   - Commit and push their change:  
     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Added initial comment for [Module Name]"
     git push origin main
     ```

2. **Pull and Merge Changes:**  
   - All students should pull the latest changes to keep their local copies updated:  
     ```bash
     git pull origin main
     ```

### **Task for Students:**  
- Confirm that each student has made their initial commit and pushed it to GitHub.
